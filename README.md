A modern and elegant music player, designed to enhance your desktop music experience with a vibrant and visually appealing interface.

- Utilizes GPUI (from the creators of world-class code editor Zed) for a native, sleek, and responsive user interface (no bloat from webview-based frameworks)
- Supports a wide range of audio formats for versatile playback
- Integrates streaming from YouTube Music (and potentially other sources in the future)
